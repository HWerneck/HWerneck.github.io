A Rebelião da Pontuação
BOOK COVER
Original: A Rebelião da Pontuação
Author: William Tucci
English: The Punctuation Rebellion (freely translated, as there is no translated version of the book)

*The Punctuation Rebellion* is one of the first books I have read and liked when a kid. It was entertaining and also raised my attention to grammar. Yep! Grammar, dude.

In a fun way, good for kids (and for adults with grammar or memory issues), the book explores what would happen to language if the punctuation decided to rebel. It shows us why using the punctuation is important, using it correctly.

The book follows the story of Bruno who is prived of his sleep when the question mark decides that he does not want to point questions anymore (he wants to exclamate!). The story follows with the other punctuation marks adhering to the rebellion and a big mess for Bruno to solve.

It is a small book, quick and fun read for kids. Good for adults to remember why correct punctuation is important too, seeing how our mistakes are perceived by others when we fail.
