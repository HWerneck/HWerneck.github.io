O Pequeno Príncipe
BOOK COVER
English: The Little Prince
Original: Le Petit Prince

The Little Prince. I have heard about and seen this book a lot before reading it. I thought it seemed like another children's book. Maybe a story for girls, about this little prince and stuff. Boring and unworthy of attention, certainly.

Boy, was I wrong.

What a magical book.
I got it for my wife, actually. She asked me to buy it for her when I was buying my first batch of books after starting to read again. She said she heard the book was wonderful and was excited about reading it. She also presented me the movie based on the book.
We watched the movie and I fell in love with it. Beautiful. I truly believe it has the most beautiful art I have ever seen in a movie. Different techniques and styles of drawing and animation, mostly directly based on the book's illustrations (I felt that when watching, based on the cover that every *The Little Prince* exhibits; got a confirmartion after reading the book), but with creative and memorable variations. Hooked I was not only by the looks, mind you, but also and mainly for the message. I wanted to read the book right away.

I waited for my wife to finish reading (I was also finishing Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) and then it was my turn to read it.
My first impression with the book was that it was going to be another film adaptation, where you read the book and it is pretty much what you already watched. But careful read and attention helped start to grasp the masterpiece I had in hands.

As a side note, I also learned early when I started reading the book that Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was not only the author, but also the illustrator. Such delicate images, yet simple, seemingly drawn by a child skilled at drawing. It got me thinking that I should start drawing again. Made me remember of Leonardo, who drew to learn, to communicate ideas that his head imagined. More on that later, but I started drawing again because of *The Little Prince*, because I realized drawing is an important tool for communication and a great whetstone for imagination and creativity.

The book happens much like the imagination and spontaneity of a child. You generally watch the book through the eyes of an aviator that befriended the Little Prince. The character of the aviator is well explored in *The Little Prince* movie. The book advances as the Little Prince opens himself with the aviator. You learn from the book similar like you would drink from a fountain in a hot day in the desert (that's me trying a metaphor -.-'). You learn the importance of enjoying yourself and others, and enjoying the moments of life, without so much anxiety and expectation to move soon to the next moment. You also learn about discipline, presented first hand by the Little Prince himself, and you learn the beauty of captivating others (in the English version of the book, the verb used is "to tame"; the Portuguese version of this part is infinitely more beautiful when "captivate" is what the Little Prince must do, not only with the fox, but also with the rose, as he treats them as friends, not animal and plant).

I will not give further details of the book, go ahead and read it. Just know the book is one of the most beautiful things ever written and definitely one of the most amazing books I have ever read. So much that I decided that every language I try to learn, *The Little Prince* will be the first book I read in that language.

This book reminds me of Pokémon, in terms of how much it has done for me. It reminded me of my inner child (which is very out there, actually), of how much the grown up life ruins us and how I would like to go back being happy and light like the Little Prince. It got me back to drawing and is now one of my base resources for learning new languages.

Thanks Antoine! Your book was a wonderful experience and I loved it!
