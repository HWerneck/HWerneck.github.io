A Marca de Uma Lágrima
BOOK COVER
Original: A Marca de Uma Lágrima
Author: Pedro Bandeira
English: The Mark of a Tear

This book marks one of the most embarrassing moments of my life, and as I didn't get embarassed, also one of the moments that show that I am not quite like normal people. So you don't say I didn't tell, my literature teacher, teacher Saturnino (great teacher, by the way) was explaining a passing of the book, saying the girl was masturbating herself. I raised my hand and asked out loud "What is masturbation?". Everybody laughed but me, and he realized pronto I was being serious and went with "nevermind". HAHAHAHAHA We were all 13. At s, all the boys gathered and tryed explaining to me what masturbation was. I never got what they meant. Even a year later, people talked to me like "Remember when you asked what masturbation was?", and I answered "Yeah", always laughing, never knowing.

Okay... (awkward moment)... (not that I mind)... back to the book.

*A Marca de Uma Lágrima* is another book of Pedro Bandeira, and this time a teenager read. And a teenager writing. Pedro adopted the style of a teenager for this story, very similar the teenage girl who is the main character of the story. The story is about Isabel. Classical college teenager. Smarter of the class, likes boys and writes poems about them, problems with the weight and acne. She falls in love with her cousin Cristiano, but he likes her best friend, Rosana. At the same time, clueless she is, she is actually inadvertently fallen for another boy, Fernando, who she mistakes for Cristiano in a party that she was drunk and likes her back.

The book goes with this setting up until something very unexpected happens. I am not going to spoil the fun of the read. To be honest, the book was getting a bit tiring before this happened. After this event goes down, the book gets your attention to the end of it. You will not stop reading until done, because it gets that good. I would like to applaud Pedro for the style of the writing. A few times I forgot it was an author writing and not the teenage girl I was reading about, so much Pedro wrote like a teenager. That's not easy to accomplish and it was a great touch to the feeling of the story and the book.
