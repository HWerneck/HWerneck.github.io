O Fantástico Mistério de Feiurinha
BOOK COVER
Original: O Fantástico Mistério de Feiurinha
Author: Pedro Bandeira
English: The Fantastic Mystery of Feiruinha

Another one of the books that I remember most from when I was a kid. Pedro Bandeira, the author, is great with children's books and has created the second princess once upon a time story with a Brazilian origin (apparently the first is Rosaflor Della Moura Torta, as he cites Monteiro Lobato, which lead me to Silvio Romero). As its name suggests, the book is indeed fantastic and a great read.

The story revolves around the mystery of the missing princess Feiurinha, and how that poses a threat to the "happily ever after" of all the princess and fairy tales creatures. Most fairy tale princesses take part in the plot. Snow White leades the other princesses as they start an investigation, and it is her lackey Caio that is sent by her to find an author to help investigate the whereabouts of Feiurinha.

The story is very, very involving and it increases drastically when the story of Feiurinha is finally being told. The book is very funny, easy language, relating to classical fairy tales. Put simple, Pedro Bandeira made a great work for kids and perhaps even a Brazilian classic. It is a quick and fun read and a good bed time story.
