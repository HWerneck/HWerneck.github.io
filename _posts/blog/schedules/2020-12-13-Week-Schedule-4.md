This week starts with a very special event. Today is dad's birthday.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD! YOU ARE AWESOME AND I LOVE YOU!

Second to that, tomorrow is the deadline to send our compiler project. At midnight tomorrow, college vacations.
That does not mean the week is a quiet week. Actually, the very opposite is more like it. This week will be marked by a very strong will of doing everything I can. I'll try to channel that towards the main focus: IJCAI 2021.

###Master and college

College vacations after the Compilers work is delivered.
College vacations. No more.

###Playing

Vacations from college (at least undergrad)! This means I expect to be done with more in the gaming scope. The aim of the week is to be done with Uncharted: Drakes's Fortune and Erica specifically. By the way, I'm enjoying GTA V a lot, since now I have my real friends to play with. I'm also considering creating a Twitch channel. Let's see how that goes after some pros and cons. Without further ado, the games of the week are:

• Grand Theft Auto V
• Uncharted: Drake's Fortune
• FIFA 19
• Erica

###Studying

• Artificial Intelligence:
    Thomas Simonini's tutorial on Deep Reinforcement Learning - [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419/)

• Programming:
    Compilers (for the [IsiLanguange](https://github.com/professorisidro/IsiLanguageEmbriao))

• Languages:
    German - Duolingo

###Reading

The books I plan to read this week are:

• A Marca de Uma Lágrima - Pedro Bandeira
• A Arte de Ter Razão - 38 Estratagemas - Arthur Schopenhauer

###Writing

Back to my dissertation. I wanna get some traction before the year ends. No big promises, just want to go back to it.
Story-telling might also come back this week.

###Watching

• Random Disney movies, once again. Nothing big planned.
• Soap Opera (specifically "A Força do Querer" - soap opera where both the policewoman Jeiza and the lawyer Caio have to put up with idiots from every social circle of the show)

###Other activities

After some 3D printing going down this past week, I was expecting to have better results by now. Anyways, I will work on that.
Plus, I am planning to create a few one-page tool sites with a friend. Let's see how that goes.

This post was kinda rushy because of dad's birthday.
I'll improve it for next week. See you then!
