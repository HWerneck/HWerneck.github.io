2021 has started and hopes are high. This year seems promising. Focus of the year is to work hard; a lot (A LOT!) of work awaits. Let's get down to it.


###Master and college

This is the main focus of the week. Actually the main focus from here onwards, as it should have been.
The process to enroll in college's disciplines will not happen until the end of next week. Until then, ViZDoom is king.
This week I'll finish the maps and one of the agents I started last year. This week I start the tests.

###Playing

Playing will be reduced until the Master is complete. I'll play roughly an hour a day, when I play. I'll keep rotating the same games I was finishing. I'll get back to new games only when most of these are complete. Games of the week are:

• Grand Theft Auto V: focus on heists
• Uncharted: Drake's Fortune: as little as possible, just so I don't stop playing
• Erica: as little as possible, just so I don't stop playing

###Studying

• Artificial Intelligence:
    PPO
    A3C

• Programming:
    ViZDoom map scripting, via SLADE
    HTML, CSS and Javascript combined with Jekyll (for this site).

• Languages:
    German - Duolingo

###Reading

This week I start reading children's books to support the idea of writing books, for kids and adults, eventually. The books planned for the week are:

• My dissertation
• Harry Potter e a Câmara Secreta - J. K. Rowling
• Children's books

###Writing

Like I said before, focus is on my dissertation (actually in my work as a whole). I am getting traction, same idea I presented past weeks.
As for other writings, I don't believe I will be writing significantly this week as my work is taking a bunch of my time.
There is one special thing that I am going to post here. This is the only writing I am promising to complete this year still.

###Other activities

I am continuing to back up my stuff before the year ends.
I increased (a lot) the list of thing to be done in my house. This is going very well, actually, and now the wife is helping too.
Also, I started watching *Rick and Morty*. It's incredibly hilarious. My wife and I started watching *Death Note*. I am dreaming about this show. Shit, I love animes.

My family is travelling for the New Year. Let's see how this end of year advances here, but I am going to post again before it ends.
Hope you guys have enjoyed these first posts and developins of my site. It is getting expanded, so I hope I have lots of content for everybody real soon. 
I wish you all and your families a happy New Year, with much love and joy, peace and also health. Take care of yourselves and see you in 2021!
