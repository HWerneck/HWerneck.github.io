Second post, still strong doing this in the wrong day. But better late than never, I say.
This week I am full with a bunch of stuff from college, still. Deadlines near, everybody going crazy (only me) and doom at my doorsteps.
Okay, cut the drama. To the schedule.

###Master and college

Almost there! I was not capable of catching up last week, which is kinda depressing.
This week I expect to finish one of the disciplines (Enterpreunership) while pushing the guys and keeping their spirits up (yeah, we had to form groups).
I would like to also start the Compilers project and maybe finish watching all classes (hehe won't happen).

###Playing

The games I am playing this week are:

• Uncharted: Drake's Fortune
• FIFA 19
• Horizon Chase Turbo
• Grand Theft Auto V
• Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered
• Erica

EDIT: I am a fucking retard. I accidentally got the platinum for Horizon Chase Turbo. My dear Horizon Chase Turbo.
But as the challenge is mine with myself, I will take it into account in the day I go for my plats (I did the effort to leave a single trophy behind. It is not my fault the game glitched on me and popped the trophy before I completed its requirement).

###Studying

• Artificial Intelligence:
    Introduction to Deep Learning - Kaggle
    Thomas Simonini's tutorial on Deep Reinforcement Learning - [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419/)
    Natural Language Processing - Kaggle (added later, since it was so small and felt like fun)

• Programming:
    Compilers

• Languages:
    German - Duolingo

###Reading

The books I plan to read this week are:

• The Little Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
• O Fantástico Mistério de Feiurinha - Pedro Bandeira
• A Rebelião da Pontuação - William Tucci
• A Arte de Ter Razão - 38 Estratagemas - Arthur Schopenhauer
• Eu, Robô - Isaac Asimov

###Writing

Last week was not very good on the writing department. I simply intent to continue the book this week, hopefully, with another chapter.
As for academic writings, I am working on my dissertation as mentioned somewhere (COFF COFF).

###Watching

• Disney movies.
• Soap Opera (specifically "A Força do Querer" - soap opera where both the policewoman Jeiza and the lawyer Caio have to put up with idiots from every social circle of the show).

###Other activities

Something happened last week, and I was not remembering: Black Friday. So this week I am to receive everything I bought (or most of it).

I hope you have enjoyed.
See you next week!
