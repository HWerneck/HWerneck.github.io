2021 has started and hopes are high. I made a list of my goals as I always do, and this year seems promising. Focus of the year is to work hard; a lot (A LOT!) of work awaits. I want to get a solid routine and be able to stick to it. My goals can be summed as "work and academic life success, being lead by a healthy and joyful lifestyle".
Ok, let's get down to this week before I start a weird speech in my head.

###Master and college

This is the main focus of the week. Actually the main focus from here onwards, as it should have been.
The process to enroll in college's disciplines will not happen until the end of next week. Until then, ViZDoom is king.
This week I'll finish the maps and one of the agents I started last year. This week I start the tests.

###Playing

Playing will be reduced until the Master is complete. I'll play roughly an hour a day, when I play. I'll keep rotating the same games I was finishing. I'll get back to new games only when most of these are complete. Games of the week are:

• Grand Theft Auto V: focus on heists
• Uncharted: Drake's Fortune: as little as possible, just so I don't stop playing
• Erica: as little as possible, just so I don't stop playing

###Studying

• Artificial Intelligence:
    PPO
    A3C

• Programming:
    ViZDoom map scripting, via SLADE
    HTML, CSS and Javascript combined with Jekyll (for this site).

• Languages:
    German - Duolingo

###Reading

Most of my reading this week will be my own dissertation. I plan to start reading scientific papers too, one per day, if I can. This will also result in another weekly series I plan to post here. Every Saturday, I should comment on the scientific articles I've read about the past week. Let's hope I can get that going before the end of January.
This week I also start reading children's books to support the idea of writing books. The readings planned for the week are:

• My dissertation
• Scientific articles, mostly about deep reinforcement learning
• Harry Potter e a Câmara Secreta - J. K. Rowling
• Children's books

###Writing

All the writing of the week will be either code, which I hope to be a lot, or rewriting of my dissertation.

###Other activities

I would like to finish watching *Death Note* with Paloma. We loved the show, but I think I'll feel what I always feel when watching animes: they always derail at some point. Well, let's see.
Me and Paloma should probably start - and finish - watching the 3rd season of *Cobra Kai* this week.
For other activities, I believe advancing towards the end of my "to do" list at home. Not gonna post it, it is huge. But I think I can work on it fairly steady during the week.

That's it people. I hope you guys have passed the year well. I wish everybody a great year, with challenges and prosperity in those challenges. Same as before, I wish also joy, peace and health for everyone.
If you guys have your own goals for the year, feel free to comment them. Maybe we can work on them together and help each other out.
