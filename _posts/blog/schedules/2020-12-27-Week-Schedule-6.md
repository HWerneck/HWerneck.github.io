Last week of the year. I was going to make a message, similar to last week's Christmas message, but I decided to make them a separate type of post. I'll make a version of these for the Christmas message too. =)
Focusing on the schedule of the week, I'll keep it simple. It is the last week of the year and the focus is in ending the year good with myself. Not going to be that simple, but I will not make impossible demands to myself. To the schedule, people!

Lousy year 2020.
I started it in Boston, listening to *We Made You* by Eminem, just about when he says "2020, yeah".
Thinking back, this was a good year for me.

###Master and college

Last week I started the ViZDoom agents. This week I want to simply finish reading all my dissertation and reviewing the structure of it. I will not be pretentious now that the year is ending. I want to get things moving to improve my performance next year. If possible, I'd like to complete the map customizations for the experiments proposed in my qualification.

###Playing

This week is short, but I will try to diversify my gaming so I can complete the most I can without much time alotted to gaming. The games of the week are:

• Grand Theft Auto V: focus on collectibles, both single player and online; heists continued, perhaps with two more complete
• Uncharted: Drake's Fortune: as little as possible, just so I don't stop playing
• LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4: I started playing LEGO Harry Potter with the wife last week; this is solely for a good fun with her
• Erica: One more playthrough
• Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered: I started this so I keep playing an FPS, moving the games up and getting some trophies
• FIFA 19: I played it on Sunday and Monday, but I want to give it some time; I'm wasting too much time on FIFA =/

###Studying

• Artificial Intelligence:
    Thomas Simonini's tutorial on Deep Reinforcement Learning - [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419/)
    Arthur Juliani's tutorial on Asynchronous Actor-Critic Agents (A3C) (suggested by Thomas Simonini) - [Link](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-8-asynchronous-actor-critic-agents-a3c-c88f72a5e9f2)

• Programming:
    Programming for internet. This week specifically, HTML, CSS and Javascript combined with Jekyll (for this site).

• Languages:
    German - Duolingo

###Reading

The only book I am reading this week is:

• Harry Potter e a Câmara Secreta - J. K. Rowling

###Writing

Like I said before, focus is on my dissertation (actually in my work as a whole). I am getting traction, same idea I presented past weeks.
As for other writings, I don't believe I will be writing significantly this week as my work is taking a bunch of my time.
There is one special thing that I am going to post here. This is the only writing I am promising to complete this year still.

###Other activities

I am continuing to back up my stuff before the year ends.
I increased (a lot) the list of thing to be done in my house. This is going very well, actually, and now the wife is helping too.
Also, I started watching *Rick and Morty*. It's incredibly hilarious. My wife and I started watching *Death Note*. I am dreaming about this show. Shit, I love animes.

My family is travelling for the New Year. Let's see how this end of year advances here, but I am going to post again before it ends.
Hope you guys have enjoyed these first posts and developins of my site. It is getting expanded, so I hope I have lots of content for everybody real soon. 
I wish you all and your families a happy New Year, with much love and joy, peace and also health. Take care of yourselves and see you in 2021!
