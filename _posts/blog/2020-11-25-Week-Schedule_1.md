So, this is the first post of my blog! HOORAY!
I thought about it, and decided to start with the simplest post, which is going to be weekly and serve me an important purpose.
For this weekly series of posts, I will list what I am scheduling for the week. These are meant to be short, and topics regard what I am developing, studying, playing, reading and watching, beside others. I want to share how I am organizing myself and how far I was able to go comparing past weeks.

This first post is a little different as I am explaining the idea of the series too, but I will try to always start with a paragraph giving reason to the schedule based on what the week is looking like. This week (I think) I will also do that for every section, to help fit in what I'm talking about.

This week I am full with a bunch of stuff from college, as deadlines are approaching (that's also part of the reason the site isn't looking prettier by now). That is occupying most my free time, but with 10-15 min breaks I hope to advance through everything I list here.

###Master and college
YES! I am currently enrolled in a Master program, in Computer Science. At the same time, I am a Computer Science undergrad student (read [here]() to un-explode your mind and recollect your brain).


###Playing
• Uncharted: Drake's Fortune
    This week I will complete Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, except for the DLC trophies regarding the brutal and the speed runs.
    After completing my crushing run last week, this week I'm focusing on the miscellanous trophies. I will leave *Shoot some B-Roll for Elena* for the platinum.
    
• FIFA 19
    FIFA 19. Still.
    I've lost a chance on season 1's title last week and ended up being demoted.
    I played this week to advance to season 1 again and now I will give it a rest for some time.
    
• Horizon Chase Turbo
    This week I will also complete Horizon Chase Turbo. I only need to complete the last Master challenge, and then race with every car in the game.
    I will keep the *Speed Demon* trophy for the platinum.
    
• Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered
    Call of Duty has been proving harder than expected. I didn't resist and looked YouTube up for two checkpoints: the last checkpoint in *One Shot, One Kill* and *x*. I will complete the veteran run this week, and hopefully finish the remaining challenges by next week. Basically, that's the *x* trophy, so maybe I can still finish it this week.
    
• Grand Theft Auto V
    GTA V is the game that has more probability of breaking my stats since FIFA 12's DLC. Not closing in the heists, what to say the doomsday heists, I'm slowly advancing in the online portion of the game, currently at level 42. I found out about the lucky spinning wheel in the casino and have been doing it daily since Sunday, when I found it out. I hope to go back to the story line, this week that I will finish three games.
    
• Bioshock 2
    If all goes right, I'll be back to playing Bioshock 2 this week too. I have decided to put it aside while I was finishing Uncharted, Modern Warfare Remastered and Horizon Chase Turbo, and was advancing in GTA V.
    Now that I'll stop FIFA 19 again, and 3 games will be completed, I might be good to come back for Bioshock 2.

###Studying
This week's focus stays in college activities.

###Reading
So I decided to go back to reading last couple of weeks, a lot thanks to [this podcast]()(which I actually heard a few months ago), but also in line with an idea I have for years.
I want to read the great books and authors in their own language. I do not mind if I read them in Portuguese first, or even in English. Still, I insist on reading them as they were originally written. Authors like Dante Alighieri, Isaac Asimov, Fridriech Nitzsche, J RR Tolkien, Jules Verne and William Shakespeare are in the list.

• Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
    Yeah, I was reading it again. I wanted to come back to reading, and Harry Potter seemed like the perfect choice.

###Other activities
