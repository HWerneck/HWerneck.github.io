Christmas.
The very best holiday and most magical day in the year. I love Chirstmas.
I was looking at my last posts and I really feel like I failed with these schedules. The intention was primarily to set challenges for the week, yes. But also, and perhaps more importantly, to check how well the week passed.
I decided to add a twin post series, on Saturday, reviewing how the week looked like.
I am adding short checks for the past series and this Saturday I am posting all of them.
I would also like to add... well, wish, actually... The year was very bad, world health-wise. First, incontrollable and powerful, the covid pandemics. But more than that, destruction to the environment, a breathing racism that I could not believe, and general human meanness. We all suffer from those. We are getting smarter, vaccines being developed at a record pace, technology to discover macro and micro through the power of AI, for example. And still, we make dumb decisions, when we do not care how our decisions affect other people, and the planet, or when we fucking act based on colors. Beautiful diverse colors.
This is the second to last week of the year. A magical week, no matter your origin, color or creed.
Love more. I interpret Jesus "love" as "respect". Respect more. You do not need to agree in everything. We only need one of each of us in the world. And John Lennon had it all figured out. All you need is love. For you and whoever is around you.
Let's move to the week schedule.



###Master and college

Last week I started the ViZDoom agents. This week I want to simply finish reading all my dissertation and reviewing the structure of it. I will not be pretentious now that the year is ending. I want to get things moving to improve my performance next year.

###Playing

The aim of the week is the same as the past week. I thought I was going to move faster, but slow and steady has been working, I'll try to keep it that way. By the way, I discovered I have an account on Twitch already. I will give streaming a go some time along the week. The games of the week are:

• Grand Theft Auto V (focus on single player, time to finish this)
• Uncharted: Drake's Fortune
• FIFA 19
• Erica

###Studying

• Artificial Intelligence:
    Simonini Thomas' tutorial on Deep Reinforcement Learning - [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419/)

• Programming:
    Programming for internet. This week specifically, Vue and the combo HTML, CSS and Javascript.

• Languages:
    German - Duolingo

###Reading

The books I plan to read this week are:

• Harry Potter e a Câmara Secreta - J. K. Rowling
• A Arte de Ter Razão - 38 Estratagemas - Arthur Schopenhauer

###Writing

Like I said up there, I will give a boost on my dissertation. Maybe enter the traction idea mentioned last week.
Story-telling is guaranteed. I am going to write ideas off of my head, into the paper (screen, actually). A lot of ideas came these days and I do not want to lose them.
I also have a surprise for the site this week.

###Other activities

My cell phone is practically dead (again -.-'). I will back it up this week. Seeing where the situation is headed, I'll back up my older phone, which was never backed up, and then PS4 and notebook. Everything backed up before the end of the year.
I also want to conclude a few little tasks, to-be-done things, that are forgotten around the house.
I want the house looking good for Christmas.

This Saturday we will have the first (actually the five firsts) post reviewing the week.
Hope you guys have enjoyed.
I wish you all and your families a merry Christmas. May love, respect and happiness exist in abundance in your holidays and life.
