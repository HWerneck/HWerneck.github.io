Here we go again, another week schedule post.
College is under control again with one discipline ending with a presentation on Thursday. I am planning to take a few leaps in my master course this week.
Challenges of the week involve more practical stuff. To the schedule.

###Master and college

Finally Enterpreunership will end. I am the presenter of our company idea, with an aeroponics greenhouse for kitchens. Thursday baby.
This week's work load is unaltered, though. I have got another project to finish: the compiler of the discipline Compilers.
Also, ~~in epic narrator voice~~ HE WHO TRAILS THE PATH OF THE MASTER, SHALL NEVER MEET A MOMENT OF PEACE.
With that I mean whenever you want to do work on your master's agenda, there will be work, and it haunts you. I don't think I will have much time to work on it, but I will sure give it a try.

###Playing

The games I am playing this week are:

• Uncharted: Drake's Fortune
• FIFA 19
• Grand Theft Auto V
• Erica

###Studying

• Artificial Intelligence:
    Simonini Thomas' tutorial on Deep Reinforcement Learning - [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419/)
    Natural Language Processing - Kaggle (added later, since it was so small and felt like fun)

• Programming:
    Compilers (for the [IsiLanguange](https://github.com/professorisidro/IsiLanguageEmbriao))

• Languages:
    German - Duolingo

###Reading

The books I plan to read this week are:

• A Marca de Uma Lágrima - Pedro Bandeira
• A Arte de Ter Razão - 38 Estratagemas - Arthur Schopenhauer
• Robótica - Jonathan Craig

###Writing

I am in debt with my writing. I will be back this week.

EDIT: As a matter of fact, I am writing today, just to have this checked as early as possible.

###Watching

• Disney movies
• Soap Opera (specifically "A Força do Querer" - soap opera where both the policewoman Jeiza and the lawyer Caio have to put up with idiots from every social circle of the show)

###Other activities

Among other activities I am expecting to engage this week are 3D printing (Christmas decorations for the house and tree) and cooking!

Watch out for other posts during the week. ;)
