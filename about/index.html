      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>My name is Henrique LR Werneck.</p>
      <p>I am a robotics engineer, working on a master degree on artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>I am very creative and curious, love learning and making things, and that is what I like the most about myself.</p>
      <p>I am from Brazil, married to Paloma, and got a brother Igor with whom I rarely play FIFA.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>I graduated in Instrumentation, Automation and Robotics Engineering, and Bachelor in Science and Technology, both at my beloved UFABC.
      Currently, I'm enrolled in a Master in Computer Science, focused in artificial intelligence, and a Bachelor in Computer Science, also both at UFABC.</p>
      <p><br /></p>

      <h3>About the site</h3>
      <p>This site has two major reasons to be. Two different people it needs to comply with.</p>
      <h5>YOU AND ME!!!</h5>
      <p>I feel very proud when I talk about what I like doing and how much I have learned.
      Unfortunately, after years studying a lot about a lot, I still do not have much experience in most of the stuff I like learning and doing.
      Consolidated, practical and everyday useful experience (the one that puts money in your pocket).</p>
      <p>And THAT is a shame.</p>
      <p>After trying multiple things to sediment my apparently vast knowledge, I've decided to create this site.
      I am going to do pretty much a lot of stuff I have already done before... but this time, I will do them online.</p>
      <p>My intention is to keep pushing myself further, since I am making a commitment online with the world (whether it cares or not).
      Therefore, this site is much more for myself.</p>
      <p>The site also works as a statement of experience, not only as the experience provider itself.
      I had almost nothing of concrete to show for some PhD positions I was going to attemp.
      Thus, I decided to do something awesome, before trying to become more awesome.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Which brings us to the second person this site aims to help. YOU! (pff!)</p>
      <p>I am going to learn, teach and try a lot of things.</p>
