      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>My name is Henrique Lima Rissardo Werneck.
      I am a robotics engineer, working on a master degree on artificial intelligence.
      I am very creative and curious, love learning and making things, and that is what I like the most about myself.
      I am from Brazil, married to Paloma, and got a brother Igor with whom I rarely play FIFA nowadays.
        
      I graduated in Instrumentation, Automation and Robotics Engineering, and Bachelor in Science and Technology, both at my beloved UFABC.
      Currently, I'm enrolled in a Master in Computer Science, focused in artificial intelligence, and a Bachelor in Computer Science, also both at UFABC.
      
      I work as a robot simulator at Comau and have previously worked as an English teacher and a English-Portuguese translator.
      I love being a teacher and I expect to become a teacher again soon.

      <h3>About the site</h3>
      <p>This site has two major reasons to be. Two different people it needs to comply with.
      <h4>YOU AND ME!!!</h4>
      I feel very proud when I talk about what I like doing and how much I have learned.
      Unfortunately, after years studying a lot about a lot, I still do not have much experience in most of the stuff I like learning and doing.
      By experience, I mean consolidated, practical and everyday useful experience (the one that puts money in your pocket).
      
      And THAT is a shame.
      
      After trying multiple things to sediment my apparently vast knowledge, I've decided to create this site.
      I am going to do pretty much a lot of stuff I have already done before... but this time, I will do them online.
      I am going to learn, teach and try a lot of experiments, projects, exercises and whatnot.
  
      Most of these experiences will happen from a noob perspective, while some from a more experienced position.
      Both approaches have their value and importance, and I hope everyone following enjoy my experiences.
  
      My intention is to keep pushing myself further, since I am making a commitment online with the world (whether it cares or not).
      Therefore, this site is much more for myself.
  
      The site also works as a statement of experience, not only as the experience provider itself.
      I had almost nothing concrete to show for some PhD positions I was going to attemp.
      Thus, I decided to do something awesome, before trying to become more awesome.
  
      Which brings us to the second person this site aims to help:
      <h4>YOU!!!</h4>
  
      Curiosity is what moves the world.
      But sharing knowledge  is what makes our world go forward in faster paces.</p>
