<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Henrique LR Werneck.
I am a robotics engineer.

<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>This site has two major reasons to be. Two different people it needs to comply with.</p>
<h6>YOU AND ME.</h6>
<p>I feel very proud when I talk about what I like doing and how much I have learned.
Unfortunately, after years studying a lot about a lot, I still do not have much experience in most of the stuff I like learning and doing.
Consolidated, practical and everyday useful experience (the one that puts money in your pocket).</p>
<p>And THAT is a shame.</p>
<p>After trying multiple things to sediment my apparently vast knowledge, I've decided to create this site.
I am going to do pretty much a lot of stuff I have already done before... but this time, I will do them online.</p>
<p>My intention is to keep pushing myself further, since I am making a commitment online with the world (whether it cares or not).
Therefore, this site is much more for myself.</p>
<p>The site also works as a statement of experience, not only as the experience provider itself.
I had almost nothing of concrete to show for some PhD positions I was going to attemp.
Thus, I decided to do something awesome, before trying to become more awesome.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the second person this site aims to help. YOU!</p>
